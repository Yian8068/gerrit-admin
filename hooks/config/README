config file per git project on gerrit.
Currently this is just a backup and isn't
deployed to the gerrit server.

In order to update the hooks, you need to copy
the updated config file to the git repo on gerrit server:

for e.g, ovirt-engine:
/home/gerrit2/review_site/git/ovirt-engine.git/hooks/config

each HOOK is named "project.config" - you will need to rename it
to 'config' when you copy it under the git repo in gerrit
